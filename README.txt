TRANSLATIONS

To translate the Open Outreach interface into languages other than English,
follow these steps:

1. Enable the locale module
2. Download and enable the Localization client
   http://drupal.org/project/l10n_client
3. Create a new language at admin/settings/language
4. Configure your language negotiation settings at
   admin/settings/language/configure
5. Switch to your new language. For example, if you enabled Path prefix language
   negotiation, you can browse to http://yousite.com/<language_code>/
6. The l10n client should appear at the bottom of your screen. You may start
   translating the interface.

Note: The l10n client does not always identify every string that requires a
translation. If you encounter a problematic string, you can still translate it
by searching for the string at admin/build/translate/search.
